# Additional material

* The best example of how to user RLBox is to see its use in Firefox. The
  [Firefox code
  search](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=create_sandbox&path=)
  is a great way to do this.

* Working through the [simple library example
  repo](https://github.com/shravanrn/simple_library_example) is a good way to
  get a feel for retrofitting a simple application that uses a potentially
  buggy library is a good next. The solution is available in the solution
  folder in the same repo.

* [Short tutorial](https://github.com/ayushagarwal95/tutorial-rlbox) on using
  the RLBox APIs. Note that this tutorial uses the old Lucet Wasm compiler.

* The [RLBox test suite](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/tree/master/code/tests) itself has a number of examples.

* Finally, the original academic paper explaning the RLBox and its use in
  Firefox
  [RLBoxPaper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/narayan)
  at the USENIX Security 2020 and the accompanying [video
  explanations](https://cns.ucsd.edu/videos/members/CNS-RR-2020/Captioned/2020_10_15_CNS_Narayan.mp4)
  are a good way to get an overview of RLBox.
